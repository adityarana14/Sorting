# Sorting

Q1) Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array and return it. In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5..... (considering the increasing lexicographical order).

Q2) Given an unsorted array arr[] of n positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as lengths of three sides of triangles. 

Q3) Given an array Arr[] of N distinct integers and a range from L to R, the task is to count the number of triplets having a sum in the range [L, R].

Q4) Merge sort. (this is the basic for inversion count).
