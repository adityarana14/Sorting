# Sorting

Q1) Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array and return it. In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such     that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5..... (considering the increasing lexicographical order).

Q2) Given an unsorted array arr[] of n positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as lengths of three       sides of triangles. 

Q3) Given an array Arr[] of N distinct integers and a range from L to R, the task is to count the number of triplets having a sum in the range [L, R].

Q4) Merge sort. (this is the basic for inversion count).

Q5) For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0. If an array     is sorted in the reverse order then the inversion count is the maximum. 
    Formally, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.
    
Q6) Given two integer arrays A1[ ] and A2[ ] of size N and M respectively. Sort the first array A1[ ] such that all the relative positions of the elements in the       first array are the same as the elements in the second array A2[ ].
    Note: If elements are repeated in the second array, consider their first occurance only.
